# Predicting fetal states based on Cardiotocography
Cardiotocography is an essential indicator of fetal states. Earlier detection of a pathological fetus allows physicians to take action to prevent mortality. The results of machine learning models can inform obstetricians in determining the fetal states. This project uses the random forest to train a model to predict three fetal states (Normal, Suspect, Pathological).

### CTG output has 4 parts:
* A: Fetal heartbeat;
* B: Indicator showing movements felt by mother (triggered by pressing a button);
* C: Fetal movement;
* D: Uterine contractions
