								<b>Research Interests:</b> <br>
								During my undergraduate research career, I explored novel halogenase genes using the Luoyang soil libraries and constructed nondestructive examination models containing anthocyanins and water components based on optical property parameters. 
								I worked in the R & D department of Gan & Lee Pharmaceutical Ltd. for two years. 
								The main focus of the research is to develop methods for the detection of host cell proteins in products and the improvement of fermentation strains. 
								I am currently a master's student in Translational Biotechnology at the University of Southern California. 
								Based on my interest in bioinformatics, I joined the Mangul Lab to work on a project for  SARS-CoV-2 lineage detection in wastewater.

								<b>A Rigorous Bbenchmarking of Methods for SARS-CoV-2 Lineage Detection in Wastewater</b> <br>
								Wastewater genomic surveillance (WGS) has been proven to detect pathogens across sewershed which is a good representation of the collective waste. 
								There has been work using different bioinformatics tools to suggest possible ways to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants and to predict variant abundances via computational approaches. 
								This project focuses on benchmarking existing methods for lineage detection in wastewater samples containing SARS-CoV-2.

								<b>Multi-messenger signals from CCSNe</b><br>
								Using the STIR model (described below), we now have the capability to run thousands of 1D supernova models that explode in a physically realistic way.
								I have used this to explore sensitivities of multi-messenger signals - gravitational wave and neutrino - to the progenitor star and fundamental supernova physics.
								My initial work has focused on relationships between observable signals and properties of the progenitor star, such as zero-age main sequence mass, core compactness at collapse, etc.
								In a follow up work, we are exploring the sensitivities of the observable signals to the nuclear equation of state and correlations of the signals with fundamental nuclear physics quantities, such as the symmetry energy and effective nucleon mass.

								<b> Modeling supernova turbulence in spherical symmetry </b> <br>
								Working with Professor Sean Couch, I have aided in the development of a new method for artificially driving core-collapse supernova explosions in 1D simulations, Supernova Turbulence in Reduced Dimensions (STIR).
								Turbulence is important for understanding the CCSN explosion mechanism, since turbulence may add a >20% correction to the total pressure behind the shock and thus aid in the explosion.
								We have implemented mixing length theory (MLT) and included a model of the turbulent pressure in the FLASH supernova code for spherically symmetric simulations.
								Including MLT and corrections for the turbulent pressure can result in successful explosions in spherical symmetry without altering the neutrino luminosities or interactions, as is commonly done to produce explosions in spherical symmetry.
								This better replicates the physical explosion mechanism and more reliably produces the thermodynamics and composition, which is vital for accurately predicting the nucleosynthesis that occurs in the supernova environment.

								<b> Sterile neutrinos in CCSNe </b> <br>
								Sterile neutrinos are of interest in astrophysics both as dark matter candidates and for their potential impact on core-collapse supernovae.
								In supernovae, they may serve as an efficient mechanism to transport energy in the protoneutron star and are thus of interest in investigating supernova explosion energies.
								I have found that the early time explosion energy can be significantly enhanced when oscillations between a sterile neutrino and electron neutrino are included.
								The enhancement is sufficient to lead to a successful explosion even in a simulation that would not otherwise explode.

										The region above the solid line enhances the explosion energy by 1% compared to a simulation witout a sterile neutrino, and above the dashed line is the region that enhances the explosion energy by 10%.
										The shaded regions indicate the parameter space allowed for sterile neutrino dark matter if sterile neutrinos contribute 100%, 10%, and 1% of the dark matter mass and the solid black square shows the most recent best fit point from the X-ray flux (Boyarsky et al (2014)).

								<b> Nuclear equation of state </b> <br>
								I have contributed to the development of the Notre Dame-Livermore Equation of State (NDL EoS), a nuclear equation of state intended for use in core-collapse supernova and neutron star simulations.
								A complete understanding of the equation of state of nuclear matter will provide us with a vital link between laboratory measurements and astrophysical phenomena.
								The NDL EoS meets all modern laboratory and astrophysical constraints and includes 3-body interactions and the possibility of a transition to quark gluon plasma.
								Ultimately, we plan to make this equation of state publicly available for use in core-collapse supernova and neutron star simulations.
